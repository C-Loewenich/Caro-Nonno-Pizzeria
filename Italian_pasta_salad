To make delicious Italian pasta salad, you will need the following ingredients:

pasta - use your favorite shape of pasta. I like to rotini or fusili because of how it holds on to the delicious Italian dressing in every crevice, bringing all the flavors in each bite.
salami - or you can substitute with pepperoni.
grape tomatoes
bell peppers - you can use any combination of bell peppers that you want. I like including red peppers because of the pop of color it adds.
red onion
kalamata black olives - you can also substitute with regular black olives, if you prefer.
bocconcini mozzarella balls
fresh parsley
Italian dressing - feel free to use store-bought dressing or make your own Homemade Italian Salad Dressing in minutes.
Parmesan cheese
