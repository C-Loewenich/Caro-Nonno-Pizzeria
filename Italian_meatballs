The beef flavours the sauce. For this recipe, you’ll sear the Italian meatballs before transferring them out of the pan. Then, using the juices left behind, you’ll create the flavourful and rich tomato sauce with garlic, onion, bay leaves, and crushed tomatoes. The result is an amazing and flavourful tomato sauce to smother your meatballs in.
And the sauce flavours the beef. Once you’ve created the sauce, the meatballs return to the pan to simmer, allowing the naturally occurring msg in the tomatoes to bring out the umami flavour in the beef. The result is beefy, saucy goodness all around.
Meatballs are more versatile than you think. When you make them, serve them with your favourite pasta. The next day, reheat some leftover Italian meatballs in tomato sauce to have on their own or in a meatball sandwich. After that, mix them into a meat sauce. The options are endless!
